A comprehensive machine learning project analyzing American financial health through synthetic demographic & expenses data. This dataset features 3,500 individuals with full financial breakdowns—from groceries to subscriptions—to classify financial wellbeing into four categories: Thriving, Stable, Vulnerable, and Distressed. 

I have been using this synthetic dataset to expand and develop my SQL skills, delving into complex joins and window functions. I have also trained a XGBoost machine learning model to classify each person by their financial well-being. I now am planning to implement a GAN using this dataset and comparing the benefits and fallbacks of synthesizing data using a Python script vs. a generative adversial network. I will then also test the GAN synthetic data on my XG Boost model as well as utilizing the K-Neighbors Algorithm to refresh the skills there.
